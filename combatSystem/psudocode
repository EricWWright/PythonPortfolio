the program will first ask the user if they would like to fight or run.
if the user chooses to run then they will be given the message of "you are a coward"
and then it will say "game over" after that the game will exit.
if the user chose to fight then it will calculate how much damage the user will do to the monster,
after that it will calculate how much damage the monster will do, then it will print out how much
damage has been done to the user, and how much damage has been done to the monster, and how much
life each has left. Then the program will ask again if the user would like to fight or run (if the
user is still alive of course). the program will loop again if the user decided to fight. if the user decided to 
run then it would be game over. the program will continue to loop if the user still has health and the user decides
to continue to fight untill the user dies or lives and defeats the monster. if the user defeats the monster then
the program will say "you won" and then the program will exit.

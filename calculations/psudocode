The program will first ask the user if they want to calculate the area
of a circle if the user says yes then it will ask the user the radius of a circle
and then it will take that input and calculate the area of the circle.
if the user said no to calculating the area of a circle then it will ask the user
if they would like to calculate for a side of a triangle if they input yes then it 
will ask for the user to input the first side of the triangle, then it will ask the user
to input the second side of the triangle, after that it will take those inputs and calculate
the final side. If the user said no to calculating a for a side of a triangle, then it will ask
the user if they want to add two numbers together. If the user says yes then it will ask the user
for the first number, then it will ask the user for the second number, after that it will take those
inputs and calculate the answer. If the user said no then the program says okay bye.
